# job_database

The implemented database system represents a simplified version of a job-search portal.

Available positions are posted by companies and subsequently searched by interested applicants. As part of the application, a user can specify a variety of job preferences, including location, job sector, salary, company, or required education, to narrow down their job search according to their preferences. Each user will receive a job report that is tailored to their individual preferences and choices. At the same time, companies can utilize this service to post or edit available positions, while receiving reports in real time about how many applicants have shown interest in specific positions.

The database can be accessed through two programs: 

```
applicant.py

company.py.
```

When running the applicant program the following will be displayed: 

```
--- WELCOME TO THE JOB DATABASE! ---
---      APPLICANT SEGMENT       ---

OPTION 1: Create a profile
OPTION 2: Log in to an existing account
OPTION 3: Job search
OPTION 4: Show saved jobs
OPTION 5: Change Job preferences

Please enter your option (ctrl-c to exit):
